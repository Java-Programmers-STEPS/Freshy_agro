It was reported that, soil type, rootstock used for fruit trees, mulching, irrigation, fertilization, and other cultural practices influence composition and quality attributes of the harvested plant . Hydroponic cultivation technique ensures production of quality vegetables, as in this culture system both plant nutrition and environmental conditions are artificially managed according to the plant need. Growing quality vegetables is easier and safer in hydroponic system compared to conventional soil culture. The great advantages of this system are that plant roots are visible and root zone environment can be easily monitored . In this system of cultivation, yield of vegetable crop can be maximized though efficient use of all resources, and it is believed to be the most intensive form of agricultural enterprises for commercial production of greenhouse vegetables </i>
